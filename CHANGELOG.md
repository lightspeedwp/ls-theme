## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a GSAP asset bootstrap in `inc/gsap.php` for class-based interactive effects.
- Added a GSAP-driven `is-style-card-spotlight` group effect using theme surface and accent colours.
- Added usage documentation for the spotlight card class.
- Added a registered `Card Spotlight` Group block style for easy editor application.
- Added a CSS-only sliding icon treatment for the core outline button variation.
- Added a GSAP-powered front-page hero with rotating proof points, interactive network background, and primary / outline CTAs.
- Added a dedicated `front-page.html` template that renders the marketing hero before editable page content.

### Changed

- Re-aligned the home hero GSAP wiring to the reusable `Home Hero Section` block style and dropped the abandoned cycling heading path.
- Moved theme and heading line heights in `theme.json` onto shared custom tokens, with H1 using a tighter value and H2 through H6 sharing a common heading rhythm.
- Refined the GSAP spotlight card glow alignment and switched the card shell to a lighter theme palette.
- Refined the GSAP front-page hero so the network background sits behind the headline, responds more directly to pointer movement, and swaps words with a right-to-left character stagger.
- Reduced the default H1 weight in `theme.json` and rebuilt the hero word loop so longer words no longer clip, overlap, or reset with a blank frame.
- Fixed the homepage template so sites using `show_on_front = posts` render the posts query beneath the hero instead of an empty static-page `post-content` block.
- Tightened the hero word-stage measurement, removed the empty transition frame, and added smaller-screen layout rules so the hero scales more cleanly on mobile.
- Softened the hero word transition so the letters stagger vertically from right to left without the word shifting too far sideways during the swap.
- Replaced the hero's stacked-word repeat timeline with a two-layer word controller so the active word sits slightly higher and the loop no longer starts with an empty frame.
- Added a subtle character gap to the animated hero word so the rotating terms read a little more cleanly.
- Simplified the spotlight effect configuration so live tuning happens directly in `assets/css/gsap-animations.css`.
- Moved GSAP-specific spotlight styling from `assets/css/animations.css` to `assets/css/gsap-animations.css`.
- Removed glow hover styling from default and outline buttons so only the dedicated glow button style blooms.
- Renamed the default fill button interaction tokens to a dedicated fill-button namespace and kept the configured fill styling intact.
- Matched the core outline button sizing and typography to the configured fill button proportions.
- Removed the outline border shimmer and kept the core outline button as a solid border with a sliding icon well.
- Added small-screen responsive sizing for the default fill and outline buttons so long labels can wrap cleanly while preserving the icon slide.
- Centred the default fill button arrow inside a fixed icon well so it stays aligned across desktop and small-screen sizes.
- Switched local theme asset enqueue versions to file modification times so CSS and JS edits invalidate browser cache during development.
- Replaced all placeholder tokens with final `ls-theme` / `LightSpeed` values across all files.
- Updated `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect the real theme repo rather than a starter template.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed the experimental vanilla JavaScript spotlight card implementation pending GSAP evaluation.
- Removed the section style contract loader for `styles/sections/*.json` runtime CSS generation.
